"""Demonstrates how to deform points of a point object at the example of 'flattening' the selected
polygons in a polygon object.

'Flattening' means here projecting all point which are part of the active polygon selection into
the mean plane of that polygon selection. The example will either project the selected polygons of 
the selected PolygonObject instance, or, when no object selection is present, generate an example 
geometry for which then the polygon selection will be flattened.

Note:
    See the modelling_smc_flatten example when interested in flattening points, edges, or polygons
    with the Flatten tool in a convenient manner. This example is not about the Flatten tool but 
    about how such tool can be implemented.

Topics:
    * Implementing a point deformation operation
    * Orthogonally projecting points into a plane
    * Evaluating the normals of polygons and vertices
    * Polygon selections
    * c4d.PolygonObject
    * c4d.CPolygon

Examples:
    * ProjectIntoPlane(): Projects #p orthogonally into the plane defined by #q and #normal.
    * GetPolygonNormal(): Returns the normal of the polygon defined by the passed points.
    * FlattenPolygonObjectSelection(): Projects the selected polygons in #node into the mean plane 
     of the selection.

Overview:
    Other than modelling tools which construct geometry, tools which just deform point objects are 
    often less critical regarding updating adjacent data of the object and also easier to implement
    in general. Less 'adjacent' data of a point object is affected by simple point transformations, 
    e.g., a UVW tag will still be valid. But a NormalTag for example will be invalidated by a point
    deformation of the PolygonObject it has been built for. Just as for modelling operations which 
    construct geometry, it is therefore recommended to instead use SendModelingCommand() wherever 
    possible. This file serves as a simple example for how such tool works which deforms the points
    of a geometry.

    Cinema 4D provides normals for polygon objects in the form of normal and phong tags. Both forms
    of normal storage are not always accessible, as these tags are not always present on an object.
    Both tags usually also store interpolated normals which most of the time are undesirable for
    modelling operations. This function demonstrates how to compute the raw normal of a polygon and
    its vertices. There are more performant ways to compute these normals, but this example has been
    written with clarity of operations and not with efficiency in mind.

    The normal #ni of the i-th vertex #i in a polygon is defined by the normalized cross product 
    of its edges #e1 and #e2. #e1 is the edge connecting #i to the previous vertex #h in the 
    polygon, and #e2 the edge connecting #i to the next vertex #j.

    To be more efficient in computation, one should at least leave out the step of normalizing all
    vertex normals and instead just normalize the final polygon normal when the vertex normals are
    not required as an output. Normalization is an expensive operation since it entails calculating 
    the length of a vector. In practice, floating precision errors would so require one to normalize 
    the polygon normal when the vertex normals had been normalized.
